                    <div class="entry" style="color:black;">
                        <p>Based in the beautiful City of Gold Coast, Queensland, OMS Construction specialises in design and installation of commercial HVAC systems.  With a predominantly warm and humid climate, we have extensive experience in cooling solutions in many construction design elements.</p>

                        <p>Our projects have predominantly encompassed commercial high-rise residential apartments, shopping centre extensions and other specialised works including the 2015 refurbishment of Jupiters Casino (now Star Casino).</p>
                        <p>Seguro (Spanish; meaning - safe from harm) is an Occupational Health & Safety application encouraging Safety First - assisting employees to stay safe on the job, reducing exposure to injury and subsequent exposure of litigation to Companies for work related injuries.</p>
                        <p>We began developing Seguro in 2014, having identified a gap in the processing of OHS Health and Safety Management.  We have developed a way to establish Employer, Employee and Sub-Contractor accounts, managed through one management system, enabling Companies to manage staff and more efficiently.</p>
                        <p>Whether you require our basic OHS Management application for Small Business, to extensive customised add on modules, including custom forms and functionality, we can tailor a solution that is right for your business.</p>
